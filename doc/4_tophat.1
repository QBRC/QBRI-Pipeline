.SH "NAME"
\fBtophat\fR \- TopHat
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
TopHat is a program that aligns RNA\-Seq reads to a genome in order to identify exon\-exon splice junctions\. It is built on the ultrafast short read mapping program Bowtie\. TopHat runs on Linux and OS X\. TopHat was designed to work with reads produced by the Illumina Genome Analyzer, although users have been successful in using TopHat with reads from other technologies\. In TopHat 1\.1\.0, we began supporting Applied Biosystems\' Colorspace format\. The software is optimized for reads 75bp or longer\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB$1\fR, \fBreference_genome_filepath\fR \fIfilepath\fR
The location of the genome on the server\. [****]
.
.TP
\fB$2\fR, \fBreads_1\fR \fIfilepath\fR
A comma\-separated list of files containing reads in FASTQ or FASTA format\. When running TopHat with paired\-end reads, this should be the \fI_1 ("left") set of files\. [\fR***]
.
.TP
\fB$3\fR, \fBreads_2\fR \fIfilepath\fR
A comma\-separated list of files containing reads in FASTA or FASTA format\. Only used when running TopHat with paired end reads, and contains the \fI_2 ("right") set of files\. The\fR\fI2 files MUST appear in the same order as the *\fR1 files\. [****]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fBhelp\fR \fIboolean\fR
Prints the help message and exits [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR, \fBversion\fR \fIboolean\fR
Prints the TopHat version number and exits [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-mate\-inner\-dist\fR, \fBmate\-inner\-dist\fR \fIinteger\fR
This is the expected (mean) inner distance between mate pairs\. For, example, for paired end runs with fragments selected at 300bp, where each end is 50bp, you should set \-r to be 200\. There is no default, and this parameter is required for paired end runs\. [\fB200\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-mate\-std\-dev\fR, \fBmate\-std\-dev\fR \fIinteger\fR
The standard deviation for the distribution on inner distances between mate pairs\. [\fB20\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-min\-anchor\-length\fR, \fBmin\-anchor\-length\fR \fIinteger\fR
The \'anchor length\'\. TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction\. Note that individual spliced alignments may span a junction with fewer than this many bases on one side\. However, every junction involved in spliced alignments is supported by at least one read with this many bases on each side\. This must be at least 3 and the default is 8\. [\fB8\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-splice\-mismatches\fR, \fBsplice\-mismatches\fR \fIinteger\fR
The maximum number of mismatches that may appear in the \'anchor\' region of a spliced alignment\. The default is 0\. [\fB0\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-min\-intron\-length\fR, \fBmin\-intron\-length\fR \fIinteger\fR

.
.TP
\fB\-\-max\-intron\-length\fR, \fBmax\-intron\-length\fR \fIinteger\fR

.
.TP
\fB\-\-solexa1\.3\-quals\fR, \fBsolexa1\-3\-quals\fR \fIboolean\fR
As of the Illumina GA pipeline version 1\.3, quality scores are encoded in Phred\-scaled base\-64\. Use this option for FASTQ files from pipeline 1\.3 or later\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-quals\fR, \fBquals\fR \fIboolean\fR
Separate quality value files \- colorspace read files (CSFASTA) come with separate qual files\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-integer\-quals\fR, \fBinteger\-quals\fR \fIboolean\fR
Quality values are space\-delimited integer values, this becomes default when you specify \-C\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR, \fBcolor\fR \fIboolean\fR
Colorspace reads, note that it uses a colorspace bowtie index and requires Bowtie 0\.12\.6 or higher\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-min\-isoform\-fraction\fR, \fBmin\-isoform\-fraction\fR \fIfloat\fR
TopHat filters out junctions supported by too few alignments\. Suppose a junction spanning two exons, is supported by S reads\. Let the average depth of coverage of exon A be D, and assume that it is higher than B\. If S / D is less than the minimum isoform fraction, the junction is not reported\. A value of zero disables the filter\. [\fB0\.15\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-num\-threads\fR, \fBnum\-threads\fR \fIint\fR
Use this many threads to align reads\. [\fB1\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-max\-multihits\fR, \fBmax\-multihits\fR \fIint\fR
Instructs TopHat to allow up to this many alignments to the reference for a given read, and suppresses all alignments for reads with more than this many alignments\. The default is 20 for read mapping (and it uses two time larger number (40) for segment mapping)\. [\fB20\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-closure\-search\fR, \fBno\-closure\-search\fR \fIboolean\fR
Disables the mate pair closure\-based search for junctions\. Currently, has no effect \- closure search is off by default\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-closure\-search\fR, \fBclosure\-search\fR \fIboolean\fR
Enables the mate pair closure\-based search for junctions\. Closure\-based search should only be used when the expected inner distance between mates is small (\fI= 50bp) [\fBfalse\fR]\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-coverage\-search\fR, \fBno\-coverage\-search\fR <boolean
Disables the coverage based search for junctions\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-coverage\-search\fR, \fBcoverage\-search\fR \fIboolean\fR
Enables the coverage based search for junctions\. Use when coverage search is disabled by default (such as for reads 75bp or longer), for maximum sensitivity\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-microexon\-search\fR, \fBmicroexon\-search\fR \fIboolean\fR
With this option, the pipeline will attempt to find alignments incident to microexons\. Works only for reads 50bp or longer\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-butterfly\-search\fR, \fBbutterfly\-search\fR \fIboolean\fR
TopHat will use a slower but potentially more sensitive algorithm to find junctions in addition to its standard search\. Consider using this if you expect that your experiment produced a lot of reads from pre\-mRNA, that fall within the introns of your transcripts\. [\fBfalse\fR]
.
.TP
\fB\-\-library\-type\fR, \fBlibrary\-type\fR \fIstring\fR
TopHat will treat the reads as strand specific\. Every read alignment will have an XS attribute tag\. Consider supplying library type options below to select the correct RNA\-seq protocol\. fr\-unstranded: Standard Illumina\. Reads from the left\-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) map to the transcript strand, and the right\-most end maps to the opposite strand\. fr\-firststrand: dUTP, NSR, NNSR\. Same as above except we enforce the rule that the right\-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single\-end reads)\. Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during first strand synthesis is sequenced\. fr\-secondstrand: Ligation, Standard SOLiD\. Same as above except we enforce the rule that the left\-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single\-end reads)\. Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during second strand synthesis is sequenced\. [****]

.
.TP
\fB\-\-bowtie\-n\fR, \fBbowtie\-n\fR \fIboolean\fR
TopHat uses \'\-v\' in Bowtie for initial read mapping (the default), but with this option, \'\-n\' is used instead\. Read segments are always mapped using \'\-v\' option\. [\fBfalse\fR]
